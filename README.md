AeroGPBuff is a Matlab-based computer code that verifies an aerodynamic force model based on Gaussian Processes (GP) with aerodynamic priors for aerodynamic analyses of linelike structures in turbulent wind conditions.
The scripts Example1c_FlatPlateAerodynamicPrior_Forced.m, Example1d_FlatPlateCoupledMean_Flutter.m and Example1e_FlatPlateCoupledMean_Buffeting.m contain the verification of the model for a Flat Plate.
The folder GP includes an implementation of Gaussian Processes, while the folder Example1_FlatPlateAnalytical contains the details for the analytical flat plate analysis and plots.
The details on of the utilized methods are given in the abovementioned article.
